## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I accomplished the first prototype of front end design by using UI design software, Sketch. 
The first prototype includes the landing page, two pages associated with showing course trends to users.
I also designed a simple logo to promote the aesthetics of front end.


## This Week's Plan

We will have a meeting on Wednesday night to discuss about the front end design. In addition,
I will start to build the static website first with my teammates by using html, css and jquery.
If I have extra time this week, I will start to work on data visualization.

## Anything Blocking?
I have a lot of homework to do due to two 4000-level advanced MATP courses. I may have limited time to do our project.
