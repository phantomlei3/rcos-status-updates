## Last Week's Accomplishments

I learned a new library js-Cookies. It function is provide locally saved 
variable that can get even if users refresh the pages. I use this new library
to conquer a problem that search on the index page can not show up the correct results.

## This Week's Plan

I will formally start to work on the data visualization because back end has provided us the JSON file that 
contains the rates of student number in each course.

## Anything Blocking?
I have several exams this week and next week. I have to balance the time I spent on study and doing this project.
