## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent one weeks learning vue.js and refactoring all the javascript code in the framework of vue.js.
I finished the suggestive search function, and also figure out how to use chart.js to do data visualization.

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to study vue component part and implement the coding of data visualization. 

## Anything Blocking?

I had too much homework to do last week. I did not have sufficient time to work on my project.
