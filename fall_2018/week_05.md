## Last Week's Accomplishments

I wrote up the new milestones for the rest of semester, and narrowed down the scope of the first demo. The reason I narrowed down is because 
we are frequently stuck with implementation of our original, ambitious goals. I finish the search function with limited suggestions.

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to work on miscellaneous bugs on the front end and try to finish it as soon as possible.

## Anything Blocking?
The team dynamic is currently low because of the midterm.
