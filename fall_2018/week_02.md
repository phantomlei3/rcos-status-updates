## Last Week's Accomplishments

We had a group meeting last Wednesday, which we talked about two deliverable. 
The first one is to finalize the front end design so that front end group 
can start to work on the first iteration. The second one is about the design of MySQL.
Personally, I worked on the search function with suggestive key words, 
but I met some bugs with jquery while running it. 


## This Week's Plan

I will try my best to debug the code for suggestive search function. If it is still not working, 
I will consider to switch to a javascript framework to continue.
## Anything Blocking?
I spent most of time trying to debug javascript. I need some ways to be more efficient.
